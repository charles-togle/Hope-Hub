The BMR Calculator estimates how many calories your body needs at rest, which is useful for planning your food and energy intake. The IBW Calculator provides an ideal weight estimate based on height and sex, using several well-established medical formulas. The Body Fat Percentage Calculator gives you a closer look at your body composition by estimating how much of your weight comes from fat. Lastly, the Water Intake Calculator shows how much fluid you should drink each day based on your weight and activity level."

They can be used to raise awareness, support healthy habit-building, or guide conversations with your healthcare provider — helping you take a more informed and confident approach to your health.";
