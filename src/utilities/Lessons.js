    title: 'Physiological Indicators',
    introduction: `Physiological indicators are key measurements that show how the body responds to physical activity, helping us monitor and improve our fitness and overall health. These indicators include heart rate, resting heart rate, maximum heart rate, heart rate reserve, and target heart rate. By understanding and tracking these values, we can determine how hard the body is working during exercise, adjust the intensity of workouts, and ensure we are training safely and effectively. Physiological indicators also play a vital role in setting fitness goals and evaluating progress over time.`,
